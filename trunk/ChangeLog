shcov (2)
	* shcov now forks a new process to handle the last output lines when
	the process terminates. The reason is that the script might fork new
	processes which continue in the background, and this would go amiss if
	the process exits directly (or would block if it doesn't)

	* stderr which was not SHCOV stuff was by mistake written to stdout,
	fix this

	* Fixed shlcov bug in --script-base= which was ignored when loading
	source files

	* Option parsing in shcov has been fixed to allow options to the shell
	scripts

	* Make total and executed line numbers agree and just skip 'done'
	which are marked as executed (in for, but not while!)

	* Larger test cases.

        * Initial release
