shcov (4)
	* Dereference symbolic links so that only one of each script is
	present in the data.

	* In shlcov, don't assume a 1-1 mapping of data files to output
	files. There can be multiple data files per output file, and in this
	case, they will be merged or if the source files are different, the
	newest is taken.

	* A race condition when storing the data files is now handled. The
	problem was that the data file is written continuously, and if several
	instances of the same script are executed concurrently, the file could
	be overwritten.

	This is solved by storing a PID-local file during execution and then
	merging in into the global data file when the process exits. The
	global file uses file locking.

	* Fixed regexp for case statements (some valid statements could be
	marked as non-code)

shcov (3)
	* Fix an output bug for things like a=`ls -l /proc`, which would print
	out on the console with shcov but not otherwise. The fix will not work
	on some corner-cases, but most scripts should work fine

	* Catch exception if file save fails (this might be because the target
	dir isn't writable yet, so just ignore it)

shcov (2)
	* Added the ability to set low and high percentage limits (the
	red/orange/green bars)

	* Add legends for files and dirs. This is _directly_ taken from lcov,
	thanks again for the excellent interface

	* shcov now forks a new process to handle the last output lines when
	the process terminates. The reason is that the script might fork new
	processes which continue in the background, and this would go amiss if
	the process exits directly (or would block if it doesn't). It also
	polls stderr to avoid blocking in some cases.

	* stderr which was not SHCOV stuff was by mistake written to stdout,
	fix this

	* Fixed shlcov bug in --script-base= which was ignored when loading
	source files

	* Option parsing in shcov has been fixed to allow options to the shell
	scripts

	* Make total and executed line numbers agree and just skip 'done'
	which are marked as executed (in for, but not while!)

	* Larger test cases.
