shcov (2)
	* Fixed shlcov bug in --script-base= which was ignored when loading
	source files

	* Option parsing in shcov has been fixed to allow options to the shell
	scripts

	* Make total and executed line numbers agree and just skip 'done'
	which are marked as executed (in for, but not while!)

	* Larger test cases.

        * Initial release
